# About Me

I'm Ondřej Baláž [/ˈondr̝ɛj ˈbalaːʃ/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=ˈondr̝ɛj ˈbalaːʃ), 
a {{ "now" | date: "%Y" | minus: 1985 }} years old software engineer from 
Praha, Czechia, currently living in Tokyo, Japan, where we moved in 2017 with
my wife (girlfriend back then).

I work at [Bloomberg LP][1] as a [site reliability engineer (SRE)][2] in a
real-time market data distribution platform. You can imagine it like Twitter,
where Exchanges tweet all market events, and clients subscribe to tweets about
financial instruments they are interested in. My role is to ensure that clients
get correct data on time and that our infrastructure can sustain the load and
internal failures. Before joining [Bloomberg LP][1], I worked at [Oracle][3] as
a software engineer in [Solaris][4] user-land. I graduated from the [Faculty of
Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University][5], in 2010. My major was 
software engineering.
