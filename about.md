# About Me

I'm Ondrej Balaz. I live in Tokyo, Japan with my wife since 2017 when we moved
here from Czech Republic. I work as a [Site Reliability Engineer][1] for
Bloomberg L.P.

I've been attracted to computers since my childhood. I got my first real 8-bit
microcomputer Comodore C64C at age of 8. I initially used it for gaming only
but later on learned basics of programming in BASIC. I continued my programming
attempts in QBASIC on mom's DOS laptop. My own PC came in late 1996 and it was
custom build with Cyrix 6x86 MX CPU, S3 Trio64 GPU and Windows 95 on it. I
started programming more seriously in Turbo Pascal, progressing to Visual Basic
and Delphi. Around fall 1998 I was allowed to hook up a 56k dial-up modem to my
computer and connect to Internet for the first time. Putting aside Windows GUI
development I got interested in building dynamic web pages in PHP and writing
command line tools in C. At some point I learned about Linux and irreversibly
destroyed all my data in an attempt to install it on my computer. For a while I
swapped custom-built rigs for Thinkpads and stopped using Windows until
recently when Windows 10 came out. Over time in university and jobs I had
opportunity to try many programming languages. I feel most comfortable with C
and Python. Python became my first choice for past decade and now is being
slowly replaced with Golang.

I wear shades most of the time outside and inside in bright conditions as since
2019 I suffer from benign but anoying eye floaters, visual snow and light
sensitivity. I am also diagnosed with POTS.
